To install requirements run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start the program, run `serverscript`. Problems must be run individually
and you must update the directory in ```os.listdir('tours/platours')``` to the 
directory containing the correct paths for the problem. 


Results from our experiment are in the `gecco_solutions` folder
